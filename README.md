# MIPS32-CPU-in-Logisim-ITA
Hello, I've been working on this project for about 3-4 weeks now. But the idea has been around for months. I've been playing around and decided to make a MIPS CPU becasause what else is there to do in Coronacation?

It can run a rough version of assembly, and with a few work-arounds it should run most programs with ease. Please email me at wolfezrawilliam@gmail.com if you have any inquires. I'll get back as soon as I can!

Things to add / improve:                                                                                                                                       
Extra instructions, e.g. more syscall functions.                                                                                                                
A TTY display with UTF-16 Characters.                                                                                                                               
A keyboard input.                                                                                                                                 
Write a small program that converts .txt, or .hex, into a Logisim-readable file for the ROM.                                                                    
Tidy up the space, and clean up the project.                                                                                                                      
Move the .circ file from Logisim-ITA to Logisim-EVO, so that I can port it to an FPGA of my liking. Maybe an ICE-breaker ICE40UP5K?                              
Learn Verilog or VHDL.                                                                                                                                      
Making a multicore variant would be so cool!!                                                                                                                     
Add more IO peripherials, like SPI, or I2C.                                                                                                             
Add a PORTA or maybe PORTA and PORTB to the MIPS32.circ for GPIO or just "GPO"
